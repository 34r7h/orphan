# User Profile and Onboarding System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive user profile and onboarding system for the Orphan Platform, removing all dummy data and implementing proper user flow after wallet connection.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Onboarding Flow
- **OnboardingPage.tsx**: A 3-step onboarding process that appears after wallet connection
- **Step 1**: Role selection (Innovator, Executor, or Investor)
- **Step 2**: Basic profile information (name, bio, location, avatar)
- **Step 3**: Social media links (website, Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub)

### 2. User Profile Management
- **ProfilePage.tsx**: Updated to use real user data instead of dummy data
- **Profile editing**: Users can edit their profile information
- **Empty states**: Proper empty states for ideas, projects, and investments tabs
- **Social links**: Clickable social media links with proper formatting

### 3. Authentication Context Updates
- **AuthContext.tsx**: Added `isOnboardingComplete` property
- **Development comments**: Added TODO comments for localStorage usage (to be replaced with backend API calls)
- **User persistence**: Users are stored in localStorage for development (will be replaced with database)

### 4. Dashboard Updates
- **DashboardPage.tsx**: Removed all dummy data, shows empty states
- **Empty state handling**: Proper empty states for when users have no data yet
- **Call-to-action buttons**: Direct users to create their first content

### 5. Routing and Navigation
- **App.tsx**: Added onboarding route with proper protection
- **Redirect logic**: Users are redirected to onboarding if not complete
- **Protected routes**: Dashboard and profile routes check onboarding completion

### 6. Wallet Connection Flow
- **ConnectWalletButton.tsx**: Redirects to onboarding after successful connection
- **Session storage**: Stores intended role for post-login onboarding

### 7. Blockchain Integration (NEW)
- **Smart Contracts**: Created IdeaNFT and OrphanPlatform contracts
- **Testnet Configuration**: Set up for Base Sepolia testnet deployment
- **Blockchain Service**: Frontend integration with smart contracts
- **Create Idea Workflow**: Fixed routing and integrated with blockchain

## Technical Implementation Details

### Development vs Production
- **Current**: Uses localStorage for user persistence (development only)
- **Future**: Will be replaced with backend database API calls
- **Comments**: Added TODO comments throughout codebase for easy identification

### User Data Structure
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  address: string;
  role: UserRole;
  name?: string;
  bio?: string;
  avatar?: string;
  location?: string;
  website?: string;
  twitter?: string;
  linkedin?: string;
  github?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Onboarding Completion Logic
- User is considered "onboarded" when they have both a `name` and `role`
- `isOnboardingComplete = !!(user?.name && user?.role)`

### Blockchain Integration
- **Contracts**: Solidity smart contracts for idea NFTs and platform management
- **Testnet**: Base Sepolia testnet configuration
- **Frontend**: Blockchain service for contract interactions
- **Fees**: 1 ETH for idea creation (testnet), 5% royalties for innovators

## User Flow

### New User Journey
1. User visits homepage
2. Clicks "Connect CDP Wallet"
3. Connects wallet successfully
4. Redirected to onboarding
5. Completes 3-step onboarding process
6. Redirected to dashboard

### Returning User Journey
1. User visits homepage
2. Wallet auto-connects (if previously connected)
3. Redirected to dashboard (if onboarding complete)
4. Or redirected to onboarding (if incomplete)

### Idea Creation Flow (NEW)
1. User navigates to create idea page
2. Fills out idea form with title, description, category, tags, and image
3. Submits form (requires 1 ETH on testnet)
4. Smart contract creates NFT on blockchain
5. User sees success message with transaction details
6. Can view transaction on BaseScan explorer

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `src/pages/OnboardingPage.tsx`
- `src/lib/blockchain.ts`
- `src/config/contracts.ts`
- `contracts/IdeaNFT.sol`
- `contracts/OrphanPlatform.sol`
- `contracts/hardhat.config.ts`
- `contracts/scripts/deploy.ts`
- `contracts/package.json`
- `contracts/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `contracts/test/IdeaNFT.test.ts`

### Modified Files
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- `src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx`
- `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`
- `src/pages/CreateIdeaPage.tsx`
- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/components/ConnectWalletButton.tsx`
- `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`

## Next Steps for Backend Integration

### Database Schema
- Create users table with all profile fields
- Add indexes on wallet address and role
- Implement proper user creation and update endpoints

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/users` - Create new user
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user profile
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user profile
- `GET /api/users/:id/onboarding-status` - Check onboarding completion

### File Storage
- Implement avatar image upload (IPFS or similar)
- Add image validation and optimization
- Handle image deletion and updates

### Authentication
- Replace localStorage with JWT tokens or similar
- Implement proper session management
- Add rate limiting and security measures

## Next Steps for Blockchain Integration

### 1. Deploy Smart Contracts to Testnet
```bash
cd contracts
npm install
npm run compile
npm run deploy:testnet
```

### 2. Update Contract Addresses
After deployment, update addresses in `src/config/contracts.ts`:
```typescript
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESSES = {
  baseSepolia: {
    ideaNFT: '0x...', // Your deployed address
    orphanPlatform: '0x...', // Your deployed address
  },
};
```

### 3. Test the Integration
1. Fund your wallet with Base Sepolia ETH
2. Test idea creation workflow
3. Verify transactions on BaseScan
4. Test user registration on platform

### 4. Implement Additional Features
- Project NFT creation
- Investment NFT creation
- Proposal submission and management
- Milestone tracking
- Payment processing

## Testing Considerations

### User Scenarios
- New user with no profile
- Returning user with incomplete profile
- User changing roles
- Profile updates and validation
- Social link formatting and validation
- **Blockchain interactions and NFT creation**

### Edge Cases
- Wallet disconnection during onboarding
- Browser refresh during onboarding
- Invalid social media links
- Large avatar file uploads
- Network failures during profile updates
- **Insufficient funds for NFT creation**
- **Wrong network connection**
- **Transaction failures**

## Performance Notes

### Current Implementation
- Minimal API calls (localStorage only)
- Fast page loads
- No network dependencies for user data
- **Blockchain calls for NFT operations**

### Future Considerations
- Implement user data caching
- Add optimistic updates for profile changes
- Consider lazy loading for profile images
- Add proper error boundaries and retry logic
- **Implement transaction status tracking**
- **Add blockchain event listeners**

## Security Notes

### Smart Contract Security
- **Access control**: Only authorized users can modify ideas
- **Input validation**: All inputs are validated on-chain
- **Reentrancy protection**: Prevents reentrancy attacks
- **Emergency pause**: Owner can pause contracts if needed

### Frontend Security
- **Private key protection**: Never expose private keys
- **Transaction validation**: Validate all blockchain transactions
- **Network verification**: Ensure users are on correct network
- **Error handling**: Proper error handling for blockchain failures

## Cost Estimation

### Testnet Operations
- **Idea Creation**: 1 ETH + gas fees
- **Executor Proposal**: 0.005 ETH + gas fees
- **Investor Proposal**: 0.05 ETH + gas fees

### Mainnet Operations (Future)
- **Idea Creation**: 1 USDC + gas fees
- **Executor Proposal**: 5 USDC + gas fees
- **Investor Proposal**: 50 USDC + gas fees
