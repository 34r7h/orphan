# User Profile and Onboarding System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive user profile and onboarding system for the Orphan Platform, removing all dummy data and implementing proper user flow after wallet connection.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Onboarding Flow
- **OnboardingPage.tsx**: A 3-step onboarding process that appears after wallet connection
- **Step 1**: Role selection (Innovator, Executor, or Investor)
- **Step 2**: Basic profile information (name, bio, location, avatar)
- **Step 3**: Social media links (website, Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub)

### 2. User Profile Management
- **ProfilePage.tsx**: Updated to use real user data instead of dummy data
- **Profile editing**: Users can edit their profile information
- **Empty states**: Proper empty states for ideas, projects, and investments tabs
- **Social links**: Clickable social media links with proper formatting

### 3. Authentication Context Updates
- **AuthContext.tsx**: Added `isOnboardingComplete` property
- **Development comments**: Added TODO comments for localStorage usage (to be replaced with backend API calls)
- **User persistence**: Users are stored in localStorage for development (will be replaced with database)

### 4. Dashboard Updates
- **DashboardPage.tsx**: Removed all dummy data, shows empty states
- **Empty state handling**: Proper empty states for when users have no data yet
- **Call-to-action buttons**: Direct users to create their first content

### 5. Routing and Navigation
- **App.tsx**: Added onboarding route with proper protection
- **Redirect logic**: Users are redirected to onboarding if not complete
- **Protected routes**: Dashboard and profile routes check onboarding completion

### 6. Wallet Connection Flow
- **ConnectWalletButton.tsx**: Redirects to onboarding after successful connection
- **Session storage**: Stores intended role for post-login onboarding

## Technical Implementation Details

### Development vs Production
- **Current**: Uses localStorage for user persistence (development only)
- **Future**: Will be replaced with backend database API calls
- **Comments**: Added TODO comments throughout codebase for easy identification

### User Data Structure
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  address: string;
  role: UserRole;
  name?: string;
  bio?: string;
  avatar?: string;
  location?: string;
  website?: string;
  twitter?: string;
  linkedin?: string;
  github?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Onboarding Completion Logic
- User is considered "onboarded" when they have both a `name` and `role`
- `isOnboardingComplete = !!(user?.name && user?.role)`

## User Flow

### New User Journey
1. User visits homepage
2. Clicks "Connect CDP Wallet"
3. Connects wallet successfully
4. Redirected to onboarding
5. Completes 3-step onboarding process
6. Redirected to dashboard

### Returning User Journey
1. User visits homepage
2. Wallet auto-connects (if previously connected)
3. Redirected to dashboard (if onboarding complete)
4. Or redirected to onboarding (if incomplete)

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `src/pages/OnboardingPage.tsx`

### Modified Files
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- `src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx`
- `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`
- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/components/ConnectWalletButton.tsx`
- `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`

## Next Steps for Backend Integration

### Database Schema
- Create users table with all profile fields
- Add indexes on wallet address and role
- Implement proper user creation and update endpoints

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/users` - Create new user
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user profile
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user profile
- `GET /api/users/:id/onboarding-status` - Check onboarding completion

### File Storage
- Implement avatar image upload (IPFS or similar)
- Add image validation and optimization
- Handle image deletion and updates

### Authentication
- Replace localStorage with JWT tokens or similar
- Implement proper session management
- Add rate limiting and security measures

## Testing Considerations

### User Scenarios
- New user with no profile
- Returning user with incomplete profile
- User changing roles
- Profile updates and validation
- Social link formatting and validation

### Edge Cases
- Wallet disconnection during onboarding
- Browser refresh during onboarding
- Invalid social media links
- Large avatar file uploads
- Network failures during profile updates

## Performance Notes

### Current Implementation
- Minimal API calls (localStorage only)
- Fast page loads
- No network dependencies for user data

### Future Considerations
- Implement user data caching
- Add optimistic updates for profile changes
- Consider lazy loading for profile images
- Add proper error boundaries and retry logic
