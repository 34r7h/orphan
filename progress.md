# Progress Tracking - User Onboarding System

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. User Type Defaulting to Innovator Issue âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: The onboarding system was defaulting to "Innovator" user type even after users specified a different role.

**Root Causes Found**:
1. **Premature Session Storage Clearing**: The `intendedRole` was being cleared from `sessionStorage` during login (line 143 in AuthContext.tsx) before the user could complete onboarding.
2. **Role Validation Issue**: The role assignment logic in `createOrUpdateUser` wasn't properly validating the intended role from session storage.
3. **Missing Role in Profile Update**: The `updateProfile` call in onboarding wasn't including the selected role.

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **AuthContext.tsx**: 
   - Removed premature `sessionStorage.removeItem('intendedRole')` during login
   - Improved role validation logic in `createOrUpdateUser` function
   - Added proper error handling for invalid roles

2. **OnboardingPage.tsx**:
   - Added `role: formData.role` to the `updateProfile` call to ensure role is saved

**Files Modified**:
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Fixed role assignment and session storage handling
- `src/pages/OnboardingPage.tsx` - Ensured role is included in profile updates

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed
- User onboarding flow implementation
- Role selection and persistence
- Profile creation and updates
- Session storage handling for intended roles
- Authentication context with proper user management

### ðŸ”§ Fixed Issues
- User type defaulting to Innovator
- Session storage premature clearing
- Role validation and assignment
- Profile update completeness

### ðŸ§ª Testing Needed
- Verify role selection works correctly for all user types
- Test onboarding completion flow
- Validate user persistence across sessions
- Check role-based routing and access

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Fix**: Verify that users can now select different roles and they persist correctly
2. **User Flow Testing**: Test the complete onboarding flow from role selection to dashboard
3. **Edge Case Testing**: Test scenarios like browser refresh, wallet disconnection, etc.
4. **Backend Integration Prep**: Prepare for replacing localStorage with actual API calls

## Technical Notes

- **Session Storage**: Used to persist intended role between wallet connection and onboarding
- **Role Validation**: Added proper validation against UserRole enum values
- **State Management**: Improved user state management in AuthContext
- **Error Handling**: Added better error handling for role assignment failures
