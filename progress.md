# Progress Tracking - User Onboarding System

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. User Type Defaulting to Innovator Issue âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: The onboarding system was defaulting to "Innovator" user type even after users specified a different role.

**Root Causes Found**:
1. **Premature Session Storage Clearing**: The `intendedRole` was being cleared from `sessionStorage` during login (line 143 in AuthContext.tsx) before the user could complete onboarding.
2. **Role Validation Issue**: The role assignment logic in `createOrUpdateUser` wasn't properly validating the intended role from session storage.
3. **Missing Role in Profile Update**: The `updateProfile` call in onboarding wasn't including the selected role.

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **AuthContext.tsx**: 
   - Removed premature `sessionStorage.removeItem('intendedRole')` during login
   - Improved role validation logic in `createOrUpdateUser` function
   - Added proper error handling for invalid roles

2. **OnboardingPage.tsx**:
   - Added `role: formData.role` to the `updateProfile` call to ensure role is saved

**Files Modified**:
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Fixed role assignment and session storage handling
- `src/pages/OnboardingPage.tsx` - Ensured role is included in profile updates

### 2. Persistent Login and Wallet Connection âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: Login state was not persisting across page reloads, requiring users to reconnect their wallet each time.

**Root Causes Found**:
1. **Missing Auto-Connection Logic**: The wallet connection state wasn't being checked on app initialization.
2. **Incomplete Wallet State Management**: The authentication context didn't properly track wallet connection status.

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **AuthContext.tsx**:
   - Added `isWalletConnected` state to track wallet connection status
   - Implemented `connectWallet()` function for auto-connection
   - Enhanced initialization logic to check for existing wallet connections
   - Added proper wallet state persistence across sessions

2. **ConnectWalletButton.tsx**:
   - Updated to use new wallet connection logic
   - Added auto-connection check on component mount
   - Shows connected state when wallet is already connected

**Files Modified**:
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced wallet connection and persistence
- `src/components/ConnectWalletButton.tsx` - Updated connection logic

### 3. Profile Updates and Image Upload âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: Profile editing functionality existed but needed better integration with avatar upload and image handling.

**Root Causes Found**:
1. **Basic Image Handling**: Avatar uploads only used basic FileReader without validation or optimization.
2. **Missing Image Utilities**: No centralized image processing functions for validation, compression, and format conversion.
3. **Limited Profile Editing**: Profile editing was basic without proper image management.

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Created `src/lib/imageUtils.ts`**:
   - Image validation with file type, size, and extension checks
   - Image processing and compression functions
   - Data URL conversion utilities
   - Placeholder avatar generation

2. **Enhanced ProfilePage.tsx**:
   - Added proper avatar editing with camera and trash icons
   - Integrated image validation and compression
   - Added avatar removal functionality
   - Improved profile editing experience

3. **Enhanced OnboardingPage.tsx**:
   - Updated avatar upload to use new image utilities
   - Added proper image validation and compression
   - Better error handling for image processing

**Files Modified/Created**:
- `src/lib/imageUtils.ts` - New image utility functions
- `src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx` - Enhanced avatar editing and profile management
- `src/pages/OnboardingPage.tsx` - Improved image upload handling

### 4. Create Idea Workflow and Blockchain Integration âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: The create idea workflow was broken, redirecting to a 404 page, and lacked blockchain integration for actual NFT creation.

**Root Causes Found**:
1. **Incorrect Navigation**: CreateIdeaPage was trying to navigate to `/dashboard/innovator` which doesn't exist.
2. **Missing Blockchain Integration**: No smart contracts or blockchain service for creating actual NFTs.
3. **No Testnet Configuration**: Platform wasn't configured for Base Sepolia testnet.

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Fixed Routing Issues**:
   - Updated CreateIdeaPage to navigate to `/dashboard` instead of `/dashboard/innovator`
   - Fixed cancel button navigation
   - Added proper success state handling

2. **Created Smart Contracts**:
   - **IdeaNFT.sol**: ERC-721 contract for idea NFTs with 5% royalties
   - **OrphanPlatform.sol**: Main platform contract for user management and proposals
   - **Hardhat Configuration**: Testnet deployment setup for Base Sepolia

3. **Implemented Blockchain Service**:
   - **`src/lib/blockchain.ts`**: Frontend service for contract interactions
   - **`src/config/contracts.ts`**: Configuration for contract addresses and networks
   - **Testnet Integration**: Base Sepolia testnet support with proper network switching

4. **Enhanced Create Idea Workflow**:
   - Integrated with smart contracts for actual NFT creation
   - Added transaction hash and token ID display
   - Implemented proper error handling for blockchain operations
   - Added BaseScan explorer links for transactions

5. **Configurable Fee System** âœ… NEW:
   - **Replaced excessive ETH fees** with reasonable USDC fees
   - **Admin-configurable fees** for all platform operations
   - **Fee distribution system** with rewards for participants:
     - Idea Creation: $5 USDC (configurable)
     - Executor Proposal: $10 USDC (50% goes to innovator)
     - Investor Proposal: $20 USDC (50% goes to executor)
   - **USDC integration** with proper token handling and transfers
